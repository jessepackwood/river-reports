###Colorado River Reports

#This web app is designed to aggregate weather data and river flows to rate Colorado Rivers based on their conditions for any given day.

#I utilize the DNR website to access telemetry sensors for flows on the rivers I most frequently fish and then grab weather based on the zip code for those areas of the river.
